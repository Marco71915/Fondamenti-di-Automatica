# Fundamentals of Automatic Control

This project was developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Automatic Control" course at [Your University Name].  
The goal of the project was to design a simple feedback controller \(C(s)\) for a given process \(G(s)\) in a unity negative feedback configuration.

## Project Overview
The task involved designing a controller to satisfy the following performance specifications:

1. **Ramp tracking error** not exceeding 20.  
2. **Resonance peak** \(M_r\) < 3 dB.  
3. **Bandwidth** \(0.2 < W_{BW} < 0.8\).

The project includes:  
- Analysis of the system's transfer function \(G(s)\).  
- Design of a simple controller \(C(s)\) to meet the specified performance.  
- Simulation and verification of system performance.
